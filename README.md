# Action-Recognition-on-UCF101-Dataset
Implemented a deep learning model for action recognition using a combination of ResNet as the CNN encoder and LSTM as the decoder.The project involved processing the UCF101 dataset, selecting a subset of 40 classes, and preparing the data for training and evaluation.Successfully achieved an impressive accuracy of approximately 87% on the test data, demonstrating the model's ability to recognize actions from video sequences effectively.
